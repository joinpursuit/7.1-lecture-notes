## What is a Code Review?

When one developer finishes working on an issue or task, a second developer looks over their code and adds comments to it that the first developer must address before merging upstream

## Why do Code Reviews Matter?

#### Maintain Coding Standards

- Catch bugs and problems in otherwise "working" code
- Create higher quality and consistent code

#### Share Knowledge and Grow Skills

- Learn the team codebase
- Learn the technologies teammates use

#### Mentorship

- Newer engineers grow by giving and receiving code reviews
- Code Reviews may happen in ANY direction (Peers, Senior devs, Junior devs, Apprentices, Interns)

## How to write a Code Review?

A developer needs to consider the following factors when writing comments for a code review:

- Are there any obvious logical errors?
- Are all requirements for the task fully implemented?
- Does the code follow style guidelines or best practices defined by the team?
- Is the code covered by tests?

## When to start a code review?

When working code is pushed to a branch and before it has been merged upstream, it's time to do a code review.

- Best practice is to always review before merging code
