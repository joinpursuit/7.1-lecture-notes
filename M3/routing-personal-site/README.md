# First React Router App

This will app will be a very basic personal site.
There are react components for a Home page, and About me section, and a Skills section already created inside `src/Components`.

## TODO: Complete index.js

In order to use react router, we have to wrap our application in a `BrowserRouter` component.
This component does all the behind-the-scenes work to keep our UI in sync with our current URL.

## TODO: Complete nav bar and routing logic in App.js

We will use the `Link` component to create navigation links.
We will create declarative routes using the `Route` component.
